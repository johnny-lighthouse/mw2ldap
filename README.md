Mediawiki to LDAP

mkldif.pl parses mediawiki user data and creates ldif input suitable to feed to a LDAP instance.

hashconvert.pl  takes hashed passwords and manipulates them in various ways to confirm my understanding of password storage in mediawiki and ldap.  This is a proof of concept and does not produce useful output.
